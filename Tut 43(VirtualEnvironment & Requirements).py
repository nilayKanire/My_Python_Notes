Virtual Environment & Requirements.txt So, guys in this tutorial our introduction will be  a little different than usual as we are not going be to using Pycharm.
Instead today we are going to work with PowerShell.It may be a little unusual but don't worry, as I am here to guide you through every step. So, let 's get started.
 First, we will create a new folder. After opening the folder we will now open our PowerShell window using shift + mouse right-click.

Our PowerShell window will appear like  this:
Note  that the path it is showing is of our current folder.That is actually the benefit of using shift + mouse right - click.
Now let us move on to some theoretical concept.
A virtual environment is a tool or an aid provided to us by Python to keep the dependencies that we have utilized earlier in a few projects, constant.
In simple terms, after some duration, Python keeps on launching and upgrading its versions.The new versions  yet being better can have certain disadvantages
for few users, because, in every new update, new functions are added to the modules, and previous ones may be upgraded.So, there is a chance that a function that used to work earlier will not work as it used to.

To
save
ourselves
from such situations, Python

has
allowed
us
to
use
of
a
virtual
environment.

What
virtual
environment
does?
Virtual
Environment
saves
the
current
state
of
our
compiler
along
with the state of their modules and libraries.So in this way even if Python has made certain changes in its module, our virtual environment can still work as before even after years.We can also install different packages and “dataframes” in our virtual environment.

To
be
more
clear, the
virtual
environment
works
exactly
the
same
way as the
Python
we
have
installed
on
our
windows / mac / Linux
currently
because
a
virtual
environment is just
a
clone
of
the
original
product.

Using
Virtual
Environments
To
get
started, install
the
virtualenv
tool
with pip:

$ pip
install
virtualenv

virtualenv is a
tool.It is used
to
create
isolated
Python
environments.

To
assign
a
name
to
your
virtual
environment, use
command

$ virtualenv
virtualenv_name
After
running
this
command, a
directory
named
folder_name
will
be
created.This
directory
will
contain
all
the
necessary
executables
to
use
the
packages
that
the
Python
project
would
need.Python
packages
will
be
installed in this
directory.

Now, after
creating
a
virtual
environment, you
need
to
activate
it.When
you
open
the
directory, it
contains
folders
like
include, lib, script, and tcl.When
you
open
the
script
folder, you
'll find a file activate.bat. You can activate the virtual environment by simply clicking on this file or using the command prompt and writing the following command.

$.\virtualenv_name\Scripts\activate

Once
the
virtual
environment is activated, the
name
of
your
virtual
environment
will
appear
on
the
terminal
's left side.

When
you
are
done
working in the
virtual
environment
for the moment, you can deactivate it:

(virtualenv_name)$ deactivate
Now
moving
onto
requirement.txt.When
we
run
a
certain
command
pip
freeze > requirement.txt, a
file
will
be
generated in the
directory
where
our
virtual
environment is based.The
file
will
contain
all
the
details
related
to
the
external
packages
that
we
have
installed
along
with their versions.By having the requirement.txt file, we can create our virtual machine again easily by downloading all the same libraries, having the same versions by a simple command.

freeze > requirement.txt

The
requirement.txt
folder
will
contain
data
like
this:

We
can
install
all
the
packages
one
by
one
by
a
command:

pip
install
package_name == version

But in case
we
have
a
large
number
of
libraries
installed, this
will
take
a
massive
amount
of
time as we
have
to
install
each
one
by
one
so
we
have
another
method
by
which
we
can
install
all
the
packages
at
once
by
using
the
requirement.txt
file.The
syntax
would
be:

pip
install - r.\requirements.txt

Code
file as described in the
video
numpy == 1.15
.4
scikit - learn == 0.20
.1
scipy == 1.1
.0
sklearn == 0.0
